# Hi :open_hands: , my name is Huzaifa Nimushimirimana :sunglasses: I am Burundian
#### In short, I am a fullstack developer, with a diploma in computer science and telecommunications and several certificates obtained via training courses followed live and online.

### More about me

I like simplicity
Creativity, responsibility, organization are the three main soft-skills that define me best at work

I develop projects alone or in a team, I develop web, desktop and mobile applications. as a freelance I have already created two web applications ( [Kubwacu](https://www.kubwacu.com) and internal company web applications ).

Love, hope and forgiveness are the most important in my life
