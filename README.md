# Hi, I'm Huzaifa Nimushimirimana
I'm CEO and founder at [Kubwacu](https://www.kubwacu.com). I mainly code with python but i can code in other languages too (C++, PHP, JS, SQL Flutter...). 
```c++
#include <iostream>

int main(){
  std::cout << "I am Burundian :)" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
Creativity, responsibility, organization are the three main soft-skills that define me best at work and Love :heart: , hope and forgiveness are the most important in my life.
